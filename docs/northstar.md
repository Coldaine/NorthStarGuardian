# NorthStarGuardian - North Star

## Identity

NorthStarGuardian is an advisory GitHub review agent that evaluates pull requests against a repository's declared North Star. It is not a merge gate by default, a hidden storage system, or a replacement for human product judgment.

## Principles

### 1. Review against a pinned North Star snapshot so pull requests cannot rewrite the policy used to evaluate themselves.

### 2. Keep Guardian advisory by default: record, explain, and route follow-up work without silently becoming a merge authority.

### 3. Make Guardian state inspectable in the normal repository checkout under `.github/guardian/`.

### 4. Prefer GitHub-native review flow and operator commands over local-only or hidden automation.

### 5. Use Linear as an optional managed policy and follow-up surface while preserving the exact snapshot used for every review.

## Approved Architecture

Guardian runs from GitHub Actions through the `guardian` CLI. Python modules under `guardian/` own domain behavior, OpenAI-backed prompts perform semantic review, Linear integration handles optional external policy and follow-up routing, and Guardian-owned artifacts are visible under `.github/guardian/`.

## Anti-Patterns

### ap1

Reintroducing hidden storage branches, detached checkouts, or local-only state as the source of Guardian truth.

### ap2

Letting a pull request evaluate itself against policy content that only exists on the PR head.

### ap3

Treating advisory drift records as hard merge blocks without explicit opt-in configuration.
